## UVIP: Model-Free Approach to Evaluate Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This is the implementation of "UVIP: Model-Free Approach to Evaluate Reinforcement Learning Algorithms"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02135.pdf). 

For the Upper Value Iteration Procedure (`UVIP`) for discrete state space environments (**Frozen Lake**, **Chain** and **Garnet**), please refer to code in the folder `DiscreteEnvs`. For `UVIP` for continuous ones (**CartPole** and **Acrobot**), please refer to code in the folder `ContinuousEnvs`.
